// Ammit AR2
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Range. Precision(450) Solar Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. This weapon's recoil pattern is more predictably vertical. "I do not think Ammit is the play in PvP, precision frame autos have not been dominant since vanilla destiny 2 and I doubt we will see this archetype rise to any glory any time soon."

// Arc Logic
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Handling. Adaptive(600) Arc Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. "In PvP Adaptive auto rifles are not considered great. Usable but nothing stellar. In order to make Arc Logic the best it can be you'll have to bump up that recoil direction and range to make it viable. Arrowhead brake and accurized rounds will make this feel like a dream. Add in something like tap the trigger for better initial accuracy or rangefinder for better range and you'll be able to compete with this auto." Year 3 S08: Season of the Undying|tags:PvP, Controller

// Arctic Haze
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Handling. Rapid-Fire(720) Solar Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. Deeper ammo reserves. Slightly faster reload when magazine is empty. "In PvP rapid-fire frames aren't nearly as popular. You could count them as discount smgs, but I don't really think they have an identity. This gun could be a dark horse for more fun PvP activities, but competitively it will fall flat. You're going to want to maximize stability and the recoil direction so you can nail crits as easy as possible. Outlaw just reduces downtime without having to kill the magazine, and eye of the storm is best for dueling (something you'll be doing a lot of with this gun)."

// Come To Pass
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability. High-Impact(360) Arc Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. Slow-firing and high-damage. This weapon is more accurate when stationary and aiming down sights. "In PvP there isn't as much praise. Perpetual motion will bring up the lower stats to compete with adaptive and precision autos, but lacking a solid damage perk really hinders Come to Pass as a top tier pick. Kill clip or even multikill clip would make it stand out amongst the archetype. Age Old Bond is the only high-impact to get kill clip but comes from the raid. Herod-C and Chrysula Melo both get multikill clip, the former has a large perk pool and the latter has terrible base stats. I would have liked to see this come with better perks."

// Duty Bound
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability. Adaptive(600) Kinetic Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. "In the crucible there isn't as much to talk about. perpetual motion or steady hands will enhance your loadout and dynamic sway reduction will help keep your bullets on target. The adaptive frame autos haven't been extremely meta since their adjustment, but the likes of gnawing hunger or summoner will do a better job." Year 5 S16: Season of the Risen|tags:PvP, Controller

// False Promises
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Handling. High-Impact(360) Kinetic Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. Slow-firing and high-damage. This weapon is more accurate when stationary and aiming down sights. "For PvP you want as consistent of a rifle as possible, smallbore adds a decent amount of stability and range to keep False Promises on target. Couple that with both ricochet rounds and the newly buffed dynamic sway reduction for a very stable shooting experience. If you want to ADS then either killing wind or overflow as great neutral perks. I personally lean toward overflow as having a magazine of 60+ would be hilarious. Finally I think unrelenting is going to be a really solid perk so long as you can stay alive. If you want to go full on ease of use then zen moment or eye of the storm for dueling will be the way to go. You lose lethality but 360s need as much help as they can."

// Firefright
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Range. Precision(450) Kinetic Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. This weapon's recoil pattern is more predictably vertical. "Similar to a lot of weapons this season, Firefright suffers from its frame, not its perks. Threat detector and elemental capacitor both are incredible on any weapon and adagio on a precision frame feels really fun to use. Because of vanilla D2 and the usage of Uriel's Gift and other precision frame auto rifles, the current day auto rifles have the worst optimal and body shot TtK, resulting in lukewarm results at best, and at worst, not an enjoyable experience."

// Gnawing Hunger
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Handling. Adaptive(600) Void Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. "In PvP Extended Barrel for more range as well as correcting some of the recoil direction would be your best bet. Arrowhead is nice, but to compete autos need some good range. For that Accurized Rounds would be the next best perk. In the first perk node you have Zen Moment or Tap the Trigger again, and depending on which you value will be your best bet. One gains stability with damage, while the other starts strong and loses stability. Both are great options. In the final perk node I'd recommend Kill Clip first for the easy 33% damage boost after a kill. Demolitonist will arguably come into play more often allowing more grenades but the exact amount has yet to be determined." Year 2 S06: Season of the Drifter|tags:PvP, Controller

// Herod-C
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability. High-Impact(360) Stasis Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. Slow-firing and high-damage. This weapon is more accurate when stationary and aiming down sights. "High Impacts have never been high meta within PvP. Taking their slower rate of fire, as well as crit to body damage, and adding in the requirement of having constant line of sight leaves a lot to be desired. But you can make this weapon work for you if you bring up some of its low points. The recoil has to be 100 through Arrowhead Brake to make your life easier. Taking the combination of perpetual motion and tap the trigger also makes shots easier for you. The final bit to add is extra flinch for your enemies via high-caliber rounds."

// Krait
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire(720) Stasis Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. Deeper ammo reserves. Slightly faster reload when magazine is empty. "For PvP I think Chroma Rush is the better play with access to kill clip over neutral perks like moving target, but having an extremely consistent 720 isn't a bad thing (except for your vault). I just think it is outclassed in this facet of the game. Both within its archetype and within the meta at large." Year 5 S16: Season of the Risen|tags:PvP, Controller

// Reckless Oracle
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Handling. Rapid-Fire(720) Void Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. Deeper ammo reserves. Slightly faster reload when magazine is empty. "Is this a contender to Twilight Oath? In my opinion, no. It can roll with snapshot, and is a 140 solar sniper. But it has more zoom, and no opening shot (godly on non-curated twilight oaths). It does boast better stats in base range and handling. But most people already have their god rolled Twilight Oath. So it would have to be incredible to overshadow it. No Distractions and Mulligan are both incredibly strong perks and ones to look out for, but not exactly something that will shake up the pvp scene."

// Shadow Price
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Handling. Precision(450) Arc Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. This weapon's recoil pattern is more predictably vertical. "For PvP these autos just aren't in a good spot. They haven't been since year 1. Recoil control is super easy but range and staying on target can be difficult. Especially because incoming flinch is usually pretty make-or-break on a tracing weapon like these. A few bullets off target extends your ttk more than enough to lose the gunfight. Making sure to not only keep on target but also out-range something like a hand cannon is a hard thing to do. One way to artificially increase your range is by increasing your damage. The best way in PvP is with a fist. Or knife. Or palm? Force push? Warlocks, explain yourselves. Going into the second fight with swashbuckler 5x is the best way to keep this gun ahead of the crowd, but that's definitely not possible for the entire match, so that's where disruption break comes in. Breaking a guardian's shield debuffs them for FIVE seconds that's long enough to let them forget and run right into the next fight with a 50% debuff. Any of your teammates can take advantage of this." Year 4 S13: Season of the Chosen|tags:PvP, Controller

//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire(720) Arc Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. Deeper ammo reserves. Slightly faster reload when magazine is empty. "This is a fun situation where PvE and PvP mix. Arrowhead brake is still the best barrel, and I would recommend a counterbalance mod to get that recoil to 100 and give you the ease of use to invest into range or more consistency perks. The “big” damage perks on Sweet Sorrow don't lend themselves to the PvP landscape, but one could argue demolitionist is a lethality perk, especially with current Void 3.0 grenades. Truthfully I'd try and make this weapon as consistent as physically possible and spec fully into stability. Autos are not in the best place, especially with their requirement of time-on-target for optimal TtK. Anything to make it easier will pay off." Year 5 S16: Season of the Risen|tags:PvP, Controller

// The Forward Path
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Handling. Adaptive(600) Kinetic Auto Rifle Primary Ammo. A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. "PvP is a different story with iron grip being added. Reload can be circumvented by a variety of ways and a slower reload never stopped people before. The +20 stability is massive and means that you could reliably invest in all range or handling over stability as that perk alone would cover a ton of your utility. Dynamic sway reduction would also help in those prolonged fights and add even more stability over time. Definitely a gun to look out for and shake up most loadouts."

"In PvP you can one shot guardians with Rampage on the precision frame. Either starting with the bow, or swapping to it to get the Rampage stacks going. Either is a playstyle worth trying once. But if you want to succeed in PvP I'd highly suggest dropping the draw time as low as you can, and maximizing the accuracy stat to give you the best follow up shot times without dropping damage.

But Under Your Skin is also energy, so you have a kinetic option, again if you don't have a Whispering Slab. The same perks can work in PvP as they do in PvE. Archer's tempo for faster follow up shots and explosive head for the double flinch can mess up your opponents as they try to combat you." Year 5 S16: Season of the Risen|tags:PvP, Controller

//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Draw Time or Accuracy. Lightweight(580) Void Combat Bow Primary Ammo. Recurve Bow. Draw quickly and move faster while this weapon is equipped. "For PvP there's two different play styles. Let's go over the similarities first. Drop the draw time as low as possible with your sight and your masterwork. Then increase the accuracy with your “magazine.” The way the two play styles differ is in how they approach engagements. The combo of archer's tempo and opening shot give you a great first shot, and an easier second shot. The combination of killing wind and swashbuckler is completely different. With this roll you want to get and maintain swash 5x. With this combo you can one shot guardians (provided it's a crit) and get increased movement speed to find the next target. Both offer different things and both are great." Year 4 S13: Season of the Chosen|tags:PvP, Controller

//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Draw Time. Lightweight(580) Stasis Combat Bow Primary Ammo. Recurve Bow. Draw quickly and move faster while this weapon is equipped. "Unfortunately my enthusiasm doesn't extend to PvP. Which is fine, not all PvE weapons have to be strong in PvP and vice versa. Lightweight bows just don't feel as strong as their precision brethren. To make the most of Lunulata-4b you'll want to drop the draw time down to the floor. Rangefinder doesn't do a ton to make the arrows more hit-scan or extend your range by a ton, but it does make those longer shots feel a bit more sticky and successful warm-up will make follow up kills easier to manage."

"So Point of the Stag is not classified as any particular weapon but some think that it will be a curated or ritual Iron Banner weapon. With hush being the hip-fire champ I firmly believe that this will be the ADS champ. If you happen to take any damage before your first shot then Eye of the Storm will magnetize your next shot to their head and you'll get Archer's Tempo to make your next shot just that much faster. Really solid, but bows need a specific play style to get into." Year 3 S09: Season of Dawn|tags:PvP, Controller

// Strident Whistle
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Accuracy or Draw Time. Precision(684) Solar Combat Bow Primary Ammo. Compound Bow. Longer draw time optimized for damage. "Precision frames are some of the better choices for bows in PvP. Strident Whistle would need to have the lowest charge time of 576 to even compete in PvP. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy back up after elastic string lowers it. Archer's tempo is still great here, as is explosive head for double flinch. Moving target is a great pick if you feel you use your bow for follow up shots instead of bow-swap.

Cool in theory, but the hit registration could severely limit Coriolis Force's usage rate. To maximize its effectiveness I'd recommend fluted barrel for a sizable bump in handling, coupled with the added range from projection fuse could make the gun feel better within its intended range. To add some more consistency moving target and eye of the storm together will give you increased aim assist when aiming down sights (recommended) and bonus accuracy when your health gets lower, which is likely when charging a fusion (unless pre-charging). Rangefinder is another great option for punching outside it's range class, but seeing as the charge time is more akin to an adaptive fusion, I don't think it will be able to reliably 5-6 bolt after 18m."

//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Blast Radius. Adaptive(120) Solar Grenade Launcher Heavy Ammo. A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. "Cry Mutiny is not fantastic at any one thing being both grenade and melee focused. But it is unique in being one of three heavy weapons with incandescent. Of the three this is the easiest to get and one of the better weapons to get incandescent on. Roar of the Bear coming from Iron Banner is a rocket, which has better use cases. Fixed Odds coming from the Duality dungeon and feels impossible to farm for. Cry Mutiny gives this to players in an easy to get format. For PvE I would use it with Solar builds, especially as one of your minor killing weapons. For PvP I would look elsewhere. The perks do not lend themselves to the best experience."

That's not to say Proximity Grenades are bad, but knowing they won't one-shot is important. Qucikdraw is my only recommendation within the first perk node. Quickly stowing this after firing to swap to a primary to clean up is more than likely what you're going to be doing. Quick Access Sling also works as there aren't too many good grenade launcher mods. In the final column Demolitionist similar to PvE is the best option, with Auto-Loading Holster as a close second.

"In terms of PvP I believe that Dire can compete with Spare Rations. For one Dire is “easier to get” without needing a specific activity or two (though RNG can be harder on world drops). It can also roll the insane combo of both Opening Shot and Rangefinder. Whereas Spare can only roll the latter. I would also advise bumping up the stability as much as possible to make the overall shooting experience better. Overall if you don't have a good Spare then you can definitely go try your hand at a good Dire Promise. Both are amazing weapons." Year 3 S10: Season of the Worthy|tags:PvP, Controller

"For PvP Perpetual Motion from my very limited testing seems to be the best choice. I don't have exact numbers on the bonuses (feels like +10 per stack). You should almost always be moving in 6s and in 3's you should be moving but maybe a little less distance. A perk that helps you when doing what you normally do is incredibly easy to choose. Rangefinder allows Eyasluna to compete with Palindrome but being in different slots means you can have an A to B loadout using different weapons. More loadout diversity is not a bad thing. The “King” from Destiny 1 has returned. Is it better than Fatebringer (Adept) and Palindrome (Adept)? I don't think so. But it can definitely hang and seeing one isn't a direct handicap. Eyasluna has an ease of use that the other two just simply don't have. It feels so smooth to shoot and has an easier entry (other than being paid) compared to the two adept versions. When comparing normal base models it becomes even better as there's no adept mods to socket and the farmability of this (come Tuesday Dec 14th) will make it a very easy choice for a lot of the more casual community."

"In PvP I really love the SPO-57 Front. It highlights targets, has a medium zoom for better range, and is very clean and open. In the mag slot I prefer Steady Rounds, however, PC players might opt for Accurized Rounds with mouse and keyboard. If you don't get either of those, then Tactical Mag will cover a good range of stats and add one more burst. In the first column I recommend Rangefinder. Competing with a Blast Furnace or Bygones at range will be tough, but this will increase zoom to keep damage drop off minimal as well as maintaining aim assist at those far ranges. Another good option is Moving Target, to get the best out of your pulse rifle you want to be aimed down sights, and Moving Target will help you when you do. Outlaw is the final perk in this slot, and great but only after you get a kill. A great roll can have it, and it pairs great with Kill Clip. The bonus to damage is very noticeable allowing you to two burst guardians in the crucible. Another good option is Zen Moment, passively increasing stability with each successive burst. You will generally kill in 3 bursts so helping you achieve those bursts is something I like.

High-impact pulses are really strong right now and can even out-duel aggressive hand cannons, and definitely out range them with the right rolls. For PvP you can try for consistency perks. Bungie removed kill clip on Premonition, so the best perks are quickdraw for snappiness or headseeker for consistency. Add on moving target or zen moment for better first duel capabilities or killing wind for better second duel capabilities." Year 3 S08: Season of the Undying|tags:PvP, Controller

"In PvP the MIDA archetype is still pretty strong. Arrowhead Brake or Extended Barrel add recoil direction which will help you land successive hits to down guardians. Tactical Mag also provides the best benefit. I decided on Steady Rounds depending on if you have Rapid Hit or not. PC users can opt for Accurized Rounds but it won't beat flinch from a Blast Furnace. Steady rounds will greatly improve the stability while sacrificing a tiny bit of range. Most crucible maps won't have you battling at 100m+ so that slight hit to range won't be entirely noticeable. In the first perk node I will still recommend Rapid Hit and Outlaw, the other options just don't compete. In the final option Explosive Rounds causes some crazy flinch against your enemies. Another good option is Moving Target for the increased speed on top of the intrinsic lightweight frame for maximum zoom.

But Perses lacks in the two departments I want; ideally it would be snappy and have good stability to make my side easier in long range. You can fully send into handling and stability to offset the lower base stats, but you can't go half way with it. Steady rounds on a scout rifle isn't the worst idea because of the weapon types inherent range, so the loss of range really won't hurt it either. Perpetual motion and either explosive payload or opening shot are the ideal perks to go really incentivise good crucible habits and make your shooting experience better, but if you don't feel like moving around a lot you can opt for rapid hit instead to stay firmly planted at B flag."

Accurized rounds doubles down into the range and you can either opt for full auto trigger system or killing wind depending on how you feel about full auto. In the final perk slot I will have to test headseeker but RNG has not been kind. I don't think it will do much, but having a tiny bump in damage couldn't hurt. Demolitionist will be the easy choice if you don't want to think." Year 4 S12: Season of the Hunt|tags:PvP, Controller

// Lonesome
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Handling. Precision(260) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo. This weapon's recoil pattern is more predictably vertical. "In PvP you'll have a better time using something like Extended Barrel to max out the recoil direction while also adding range to compete with shotguns and SMGs. Ricochet Rounds will also increase that range and give some much needed stability. The precision frame sidearms have decent range, but adding more won't hurt. High-Caliber Rounds is also a great option for adding flinch to help you win gunfights. In the first perk node Zen Moment and Full Auto Trigger System are tied for my top choice. One offers bonus stability which the Lonesome needs, the other offers ease of use so you don't have to spam the trigger at max RPM. It won't speed up the RPM but it will allow you to focus on recoil control over trigger presses. In the last perk node I'd take Kill Clip, chances are you'll use this to clean up a kill and reload right after a kill then allowing you to shred guardians with the increased damage. Opening shot is nice, but less useful on sidearms because of their high RPM. But knowing your first bullet will more than likely connect will allow you to focus on the second and following shots. Demolitonist is also a great option for more grenades." Year 2 S06: Season of the Drifter|tags:PvP, Controller

"While I love this archetype for PvP, I just cannot bring myself to like Redback-5si. Veist weapons feel good, I enjoy the archetype. But something about this sidearm just doesn't feel right. It could be the lack of power behind its shots, hit registration being wonky, or just the sound not sitting well with me. But ultimately Redback-5si is an alright sidearm.

//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Handling or Range. Adaptive(90) Kinetic Sniper Rifle Special Ammo. A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. "I would not take Tranquility into PvP. The visual noise in the scope coupled with a 45 zoom is just a bit much. For comparison Twilight Oath has a zoom of 35, and Beloved a zoom of 40. So not the highest zoom imaginable but still higher than normal. Another issue is the hands down best sniper pairing is kinetic. The Last Word is an amazing sniper combo and you won't be able to use that with this sniper. The best roll you can get on Tranquility would have to be a high handling roll, followed by range. Without quickdraw the best you can get is snapshot which only buffs ADS speed. So in order to swap weapons faster you'll have to use something like Ophidian Aspects or Dragon's Shadow. If that's your preference then you can go for something like a ranged build and opening shot." Year 3 S08: Season of the Undying|tags:PvP, Controller

I think both are true, but the Enyo-D still has some shortcomings when it comes to comparing against the both. Enyo-D does not have kill clip. Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both. The zoom field has been condensed, but the 16 zoom smgs will still be some of the best out of the gate. Steady hands also brings up one of Enyo-D's weakest stats and makes it feel incredibly fluid.

// Night Terror
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Impact. Adaptive(20) Arc Sword Heavy Ammo. Heavy Attack- Launch a heavy uppercut attack. Heavy attacks are stronger with full energy. "While an extremely aesthetically pleasing weapon, the Night Terror still has the same issues as other swords; being a sword. Swords are not meta and haven't been meta for a very long time. At least for PvE you can make do in something like Crown of Sorrows during certain encounters. But nothing really stands out as this sword being beneficial over literally any other sword."

// Razor's Edge
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Impact. Vortex(20) Void Sword Heavy Ammo. Heavy Attack- Launch a heavy spin attack. Heavy attacks are stronger with full energy. "The Iron Banner origin trait looks really strong, but it fell on two weapons that really can't take advantage of it. If Razor's Edge also got eager edge you can really be a menace being removed from radar and flying around. But being a standard vortex frame hinders its ability to perform in all aspects of PvP."

Heavy attacks are stronger with full energy. "For PvP this is easy. Tireless blade to get more kills by generating ammo every other kill. Assassin's blade for faster movement speed (like killing wind) or en garde for slightly better damage if you're up against a super. Or really want to use the ranged attack."

"In PvP I can imagine a bunch of hilarious antics with this sword. Tireless blade is definitely the call as every other powered kill rewards ammo, and that includes the ranged attack.

//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Impact. Adaptive(20) Void Sword Heavy Ammo. Heavy Attack- Launch a heavy uppercut attack. Heavy attacks are stronger with full energy. "While the Half Truths might be the best in PvE and PvP for zooming around the map. The Other Half will be the best for straight up damage. Pick your poison and enjoy."

// Hollow Denial
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Range. Adaptive(1000) Void Trace Rifle Special Ammo. A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. "In PvP trace rifles are like suped up auto rifles, but the scavenger nerf really put a damper on their usability. Rangefinder is the best in slot. But overall, you're better off using any auto rifle over a trace rifle." Year 5 S17: Season of the Haunted|tags:PvP, Controller

// Retraced Path
//notes: ( 06NoMWpvpBold.txt ): (PvP Controller) Recommended MW: Stability or Range. Adaptive(1000) Solar Trace Rifle Special Ammo. A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. "For PvP I am not sure this will really shake up the sandbox. But it's for sure an interesting play and will allow some loadout diversity as you can pair a trace rifle with an exotic."
